scripts used for the Ortholog selection and SNP comparison
After running OrthoMCL with the desired species we get the group file from the OrthoMCL. We need find_pairs.py to select one sequence id per species. 
Thereafter we need Percentage.10May.py to calculate the percentage similarity between the species in pairwise manner.
